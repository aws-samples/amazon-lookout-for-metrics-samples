# Amazon Lookout for Metrics

Amazon Lookout for Metrics is a new service that detects outliers in your time-series data, determines their root causes, and
enables you to quickly take action. Built from the same technology used by Amazon.com, Amazon Lookout for Metrics reï¬‚ects
20 years of expertise in outlier detection and machine learning.

## First Steps:

Your first stop should be this folder: [getting_started/](getting_started/) it includes:

1. A detailed overview of Lookout for Metrics' capabilities and concepts. 
1. A sample dataset to use to understand the service.
1. Walkthroughs for the console and Jupyter notebooks for interacting with the service.
1. A CloudFormation template for deploying all resources into a SageMaker Notebook Instance to explore the material in your own account.
