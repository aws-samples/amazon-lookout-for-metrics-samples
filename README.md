1. A detailed overview of Lookout for Metrics' capabilities and concepts. 
1. A sample dataset to use to understand the service.
1. Walkthroughs for the console and Jupyter notebooks for interacting with the service.
1. A CloudFormation template for deploying all resources into a SageMaker Notebook Instance to explore the material in your own account.
