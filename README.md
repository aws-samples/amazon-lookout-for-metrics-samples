# Amazon Lookout for Metrics

Amazon Lookout for Metrics is a new service that detects outliers in your time-series data, determines their root causes, and
enables you to quickly take action. Built from the same technology used by Amazon.com, Amazon Lookout for Metrics reï¬‚ects
20 years of expertise in outlier detection and machine learning.

## First Steps:

Your first stop should be this folder: [getting_started/](getting_started/) it includes:

1. A detailed overview of Lookout for Metrics' capabilities and concepts. 
1. A sample dataset to use to understand the service.
1. Walkthroughs for the console and Jupyter notebooks for interacting with the service.
1. A CloudFormation template for deploying all resources into a SageMaker Notebook Instance to explore the material in your own account.

If you have a specific question, check out the [Cheat Sheet](LookoutForMetricsCheatSheet.md). If you still have a question or encounter an error, please open and issue in this repository so we can address it!

## What Next?

The [next_steps/](next_steps/) directory houses additional resources for learning more about Lookout for Metrics. 

**Available Now:**

1. Human Readable Alerts - [next_steps/readable_alerts/](next_steps/readable_alerts/) folder contains a CloudFormation template that will deploy a solution to convert JSON alert responses into human readable plain text.
1. Human Readable Alerts in HTML email - [next_steps/readable_alerts_html/](next_steps/readable_alerts_html/) folder contains a CloudFormation template that will deploy a solution to send alerts in HTML email format.
1. Cost Calculator - [next_steps/cost_calculator/](next_steps/cost_calculator/) folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that can guide you through estimating the costs of running your workload.
1. Kinesis Data Stream connector for Lookout for Metrics - [next_steps/kinesis_stream_connector/](next_steps/kinesis_stream_connector/) contains a deployable framework for mapping a Kinesis Data Stream into S3, as well as the automation to build and activate a live detector from it. 

**Coming Soon:**

1. More examples with real world datasets.
1. Integration with 3rd party solutions via API Gateway
